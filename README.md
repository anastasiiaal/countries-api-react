## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties + SCSS
- JavaScript
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- React Router
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)
- Loads of thinking üß†

### What I learned

The main goal of taking this challenge was to improve my React.js knowledge, including the use of components, states, effects, and also React Router, links, params, etc. Most of these were new to me, so i'm kind of proud of myself for accomplishing this task (to a certain extent, of course, no one is perfect at their firsts)

Goal number two was to get more confident using APIs. Happy to say, this one has been accomplished, too.
